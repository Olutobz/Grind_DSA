/**
 * Robinhood is famous for its referral program. Itâ€™s exciting to see our users
 * spreading the word across their friends and family.
 * One thing that is interesting about the program is the network effect it creates.
 * We would like to build a dashboard to track the status of the program. Specifically,
 * we would like to learn about how people refer others through the chain of referral.
 * <p>
 * For the purpose of this question, we consider that a person refers all other people down the referral chain. For example, A refers B, C, and D in a referral chain of A -> B -> C -> D. Please build a leaderboard for the top 3 users who have the most referred users along with the referral count.
 * Referral rules:
 * A user can only be referred once.
 * Once the user is on the RH platform, he/she cannot be referred by other users. For example: if A refers B, no other user can refer A or B since both of them are on the RH platform.
 * Referrals in the input will appear in the order they were made.
 * <p>
 * Leaderboard rules:
 * The user must have at least 1 referral count to be on the leaderboard.
 * The leaderboard contains at most 3 users.
 * The list should be sorted by the referral count in descending order.
 * If there are users with the same referral count, break the ties by the alphabetical order of the username.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * Input
 * rh_users = ["A", "B", "C"]
 * | | |
 * v v v
 * new_users = ["B", "C", "D"]
 * Output
 * ["A 3", "B 2", "C 1"]
 * [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
 * [memory limit] 1 GB
 *
 *
 * [input] array.string rh_users
 * A list of referring users.
 * [input] array.string new_users
 * A list of user that was referred by the users in the referrers array with the same order.
 * [output] array.string
 * An array of 3 users on the leaderboard. Each of the element here
 * would have the "[user] [referral count]" format. For example, "A 4".
 *  </pre>

    //1. Building the Referral Network:
    //A graph-like structure is created using a Map to represent users and their referrals.
    //Each user is represented as a Node with a list of referred users (children).
    //Referrals are added as edges between nodes in the graph.

    //2. Calculating Referrals:
    //A Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is used to
    // recursively count the number of referrals for each user.
    //The DFS starts from a user and traverses their referral tree,
    // incrementing the count for each child.

    //3. Building the Leaderboard:
    //A PriorityQueue is used to efficiently sort users based on their referral count.
    //Users with higher referral counts are prioritized, and ties are broken alphabetically.
    //The top 3 users are extracted from the queue and added to the leaderboard.
