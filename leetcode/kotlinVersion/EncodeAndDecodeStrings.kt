/**
 * Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string.
 * The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.
 * Please implement encode and decode
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]
 * Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
 * Explanation:
 * One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
 * Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= strs.length < 100
 * 0 <= strs[i].length < 200
 * strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
