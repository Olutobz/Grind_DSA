/*  The number 1112221111 can be read out as "one, one, one, two, ..." etc: saying each digit from left to right.
    However, we could be more efficient by grouping like digits. In this case: "three ones, three twos, four ones."
    This leads to the encoding 313241 (read it out loud!).
    Write a program to encode integers in this way.

    Note: consider the speed of your program: try to avoid expensive string operations.
    111222. -> 3132
    3, 1, 3, 2 -->. 3132

    O(1) space
    Any ideas?
